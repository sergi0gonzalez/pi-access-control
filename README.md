# PI- Multi-method access control (Controlo de acessos multi-m√©todo)
In the control of access to a building it is normal that there is a verification of the identity of a person. These verification can be made by a human or by a machine. The latter frees a human agent from the tedious (and error prone) task of identifying people (often relying on memory) and logging them in and out. Authenticating people should be flexible, in order to attain personal preferences and avoid discontentment, without, relaxing the level of confidence implicit in the authentication process.
The purpose of this work is to conceive, realize, and experiment a prototype of a multi-method authentication portic using hardware.
